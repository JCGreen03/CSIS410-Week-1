        <p>Welcome to our organization. We are dedicated to providing services in a christlike manner.
        For years, we have provided quality communication, products, and other services. We are a God-fearing, American made, and
        family focused organization dedicated to serving others and, above all, providing quality service in the name of
        our Lord Jesus Christ.

        <p>Our founder was Guy Mann. Guy was lost in life, but when he found the Lord during his late teens,
            he quickly found his calling in serving others in the name of God. He quickly formed this organization
            in order to further his mission of providing service and doing so in a Godly way. For the past
            years, we have reached over a dozen communities with our projects and provided products to hundreds more.
