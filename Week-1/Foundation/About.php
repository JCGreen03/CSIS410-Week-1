        At The Newly Risen, we are dedicated to providing services to communities in need in a christlike manner. 
        For years, we have provided quality services to communities in need, including construction, disaster relief, and outreach events. 
        We are a God-fearing, American owned, and family focused organization dedicated to serving others and, above 
        all, spreading the gospel in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ. Our organization provides the products and services 
        one needs to effectively set up your next event or provide relief to any disaster that may strike.

        Our founder was Guy Mann. Guy was lost in life, but when he found the Lord during his late teens, 
        he quickly found his calling in serving others in the name of God. He quickly formed this organization 
        in order to further his mission of providing service and doing so in a Godly way. For the past 
        decade, we have reached over a dozen communities with our projects and provided products to hundreds more.
